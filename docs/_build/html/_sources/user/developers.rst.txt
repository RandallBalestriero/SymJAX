We would appreciate any contribution! If you are willing to help, we recommand to follow the following steps before requesting a pull request


#. **Coding conventions**: we used the `PEP8 style guide for Python Code <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_

#. **Docstrings**: we used the `numpydoc docstring guide <https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html>`_ for documenting the functions directly from the docstrings and automatically generating the documentation with `sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_. Please provide codes with up-to-date docstrings.

#. **Documentation build**: make sure than the documentation successfully builds by running ``make html`` inside the ``SymJAX/docs`` repository.

#. **Testing your code**: please ensure that your code passes the benchmark tests by running ``pytest`` in the repository root.
